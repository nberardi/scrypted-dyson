### FAQ's

#### How do I know when my setup is complete?

A value you appear in the `Token` field.  

#### No matter what I am trying, I am unable to get an email code. What is happening?

The Dyson API prevents multiple login's at the same time. However once the `Token` code has been retreived and `Local Password` has been downloaded for each device the cloud connection is no longer needed.  If you are running into trouble log out of your Dyson App, and wait for 15 minutes before clicking `Release Plugin`.  At that time you should receive a new email code.
